I would like a Python program that takes a Markdown file containing fenced code blocks and displays it as
an interactive browser presentation using Reveal.js.

The presentation should be created from the Markdown file as follows:

- Markdown headers and subheads as leveled bullet points. Collect these on a slide until you encounter a fenced code
  block, then display the bullet points on that slide.
- The code blocks as code examples, each on their own slide.
- Then the next Markdown header and subheads as a slide.
- Then the next code block as a slide.
- And so on.

The code examples should be a large font and scrollable
