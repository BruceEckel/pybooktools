I'd like a Python script that takes a markdown file and produces a
[Marp](https://marp.app/) presentation by processing it as follows:

1. Each Markdown header/subhead (lines starting with #, ##, ###, etc.) becomes
   A bullet point in the resulting slides
2. Each fenced code example in the Markdown becomes a slide, with appropriate syntax highlighting
3. The program creates output in the subdirectory `.marp` and then runs Marp
   on that result, to start the slide show.
4. Use the "Uncover" Marp theme
