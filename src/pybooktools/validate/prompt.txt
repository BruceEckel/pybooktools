Create a Python file containing a class `Show` with a `__call__` method that has the same signature as print(). 

For `show = Show()`, a call to `show("example output")` will:

1. Display the argument(s) using print() as in, print("example output")

2. Capture the output and compare it to the "output comment lines" that immediately follow it.
   - Each output comment line begins with `#: ` so in this case the comment line should be:
     #: example output
   - The show() call compares the contents of `#: example output` with the "example output" argument to show()
   - If the call to show() produces multiple output lines, each line is represented with its own `#: ` output comment line.

3. The output comment line(s) are indented the same as the `show()` on the previous line.

4. If there are no output comment lines immediately after the call to show(), the appropriate lines
   are created and added to the Python source file containing the call to show().

5. If output comment lines do exist immediately after the call to show() but they are incorrect,
   then they are replaced by the corrected lines in the Python source file containing the call to show().

My highest priority is a well-designed, elegant, easy-to-understand and easy-to-modify solution.

Update: Find the first show() that is followed by incorrect or nonexistent output comment lines.
Fix the output comment lines for only that version of show. 
Then re-run the file, which will be successful until the next incorrect or nonexistent output comment lines.
Fix the new case, then repeat until there are no more show()s to correct.
