For that file it creates an object of a class starting with:

```python
@dataclass
class Example:
    example_path: Path
    source_code_1: str = ""
    source_code_2: str = ""
    ...
```

Add fields and methods to `Example` as necessary.





Now use:
ocl_container = OCLContainer.read(check_dir / "ocl_container.pickle")
To construct the OCLContainer that was generated by running Python on the file.

Create `ocl_results` by replacing the `oclgen()` calls in `ocl_printer_1` with their corresponding OCL.raw_print,
followed by their OCL.output_lines.
Store `ocl_results` in `check_dir / original_file_name`.



Create a new directory beneath the directory of the file being tested.
Give that directory the name of the original script followed by `_check`.
We will refer to its Path as `check_dir`.
Store all the following files in that directory.

Store `ocl_printer_1` in a file with the name of the original script followed by a `_1.py`.

Copy `ocl_printer_1` into `ocl_printer_2`.
At the top of `ocl_printer_2`, insert the two lines:

from pybooktools.ocl import OCLContainer
oclgen = OCLContainer()

At the end of `ocl_printer_2`, append the line:
oclgen.write(check_dir / "ocl_container.pickle")
