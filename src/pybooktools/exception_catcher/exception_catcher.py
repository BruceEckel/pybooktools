"""
Context manager that catches exceptions and prints their error messages,
and can be used as a callable via its __call__ method.

When used as a callable, argument evaluation must be delayed until inside
the context manager in case argument evaluation raises an exception.
To do this the function should be provided as a zero-argument callable.
If the function takes arguments, it must be wrapped in a lambda to delay evaluation.
