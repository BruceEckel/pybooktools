# pybooktools

Tools I use for writing Python books.

- [Documentation](https://bruceeckel.github.io/pybooktools/)

- To deploy updated documentation: `mkdocs gh-deploy`

TODO:
- Checker to see if all files in a chapter example directory are used in that chapter.
- Tool that extracts one example or all examples from a chapter back to it's source code.
