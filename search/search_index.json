Repository NOTE: This repository is under development so everything might not be working as described here. Installation If you are only using validate_output.py you do not need to pip install this package, but just include it in your project. If you install the package using: pip install git+https://github.com/BruceEckel/pybooktools.git You will get the command-line shortcuts shown in the subsections below. If you clone the repository, you can install it by moving to the root directory of the repository and using: pip install -e . The -e is optional but it makes the installation editable. Without the -e you can make changes to the code but these will not be reflected in the running installation. Slug Line Shortcut: slug The \"Slug Line\" (a term from journalism) not only tells the reader which file this is, it also enables update_markdown_code_listings.py to update the code listing in the book from the source file. Automatically adds the commented file name at the top of each Python file, in the form: #: file_name.py If the slug line does not exist it is added. If it exists and is incorrect it is corrected. If it exists and is correct, no changes are made. Changes are reported by the program. Run python slug_line.py -h for details on how to use it. Validate Output This tool allows you to include console output in your examples, and to ensure the output is correct when the program runs. To use, include this import in your example: from validate_output import console Then, at any point in your example you can add this: console == \"\"\" output string \"\"\" The output string will be checked against the actual console output when the program runs. You may use multiple console == expressions throughout your example. You can also insert empty console == \"\"\"\"\"\" expressions and use update_console_output.py to initialize the outputs. Update Console Output Shortcut: upcon Updates or clears 'console ==' output sections in Python examples that use validate_output . When updating, produces the actual output from the example since the last console == and inserts it, so that the output is correct and the example will run successfully without reporting any errors in the console == output. Run python update_console_output.py -h for details on how to use it. Note : This works only on the Python files, and not the examples embedded in Markdown documents. To update those after you've run this program, use: update_markdown_code_listings.py . Update Markdown Code Listings Shortcut: uplist Looks in Markdown files for listings with sluglines (those without are ignored), and updates those listings from the source code repository. You must provide the path to at least one source code repository, as a Markdown comment in the form: These can appear anywhere in the file. If you provide more than one source code repository, you must ensure there are no duplicate file names across those directories, as the program searches across all of them for the file name in the slugline and chooses the first one it encounters. Run python update_markdown_code_listings.py -h for details on how to use it. Recommended Usage The easiest way to use these tools is to incorporate them in either your automated build or in a script that you run whenever you need to update.
