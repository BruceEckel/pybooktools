I'm writing Python examples and I'd like a utility that runs top-level statements (TLS) so that:
1. If the TLS is sucessful the result is printed. If the result is None then we assume that the TLS has a side effect and do not print None.
2. If the TLS throws an exception, that exception is caught and the error message is displayed.

This utility should be as minimal & non-intrusive as possible, to keep from distracting from the meaning of the examples.
In addition, it would be great if the utility could be used once for a group of TLS's, again to make it less obtrusive.
